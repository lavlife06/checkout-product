## Created a basic checkout functionality where one can even modify some rules and play with it

- You will have to pass name of the listed products.
- Gnerally data is retrieved or stored with Ids and so internally I have implemented with the Ids but for sake of testing I have still given name input
- I have used constructor for the purpose because that's what was shown in README.md
